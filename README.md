## WORKING
1. The application allows users to choose one of the five choices of the game- rock, paper, scissors, lizard or spock. 
2. Once the user and the computer chooses, the application decides the winner of the current round.
3. A tournament consists of 3 rounds, and the game continues until the first player scores 3.
4. User also has an option to play again, and start a new tournament.

## My Learnings
- The major takeaway from this project was the use of animations to add the effects of a fun, light game.
- I also got an opportunity to use `setTimeout()`, and learn a new CSS property `pointer-events` to disable click/ hover on game options once user selects.

## Challenges
- Designing the overall application was incredibly challenging, more so to make use of animations to render an effect of a game.
